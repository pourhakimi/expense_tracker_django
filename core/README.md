# expense_tracker_django

A basic Django web app using CRUD functions to keep track of expenses. 

1. Create a new expense with the following data: Description, Amount, Type, and Transaction (Debit/Credit).
2. Read expense list. 
3. Delete entire row. 
4. Update data.

This is the **Expense Form** found on http://127.0.0.1:8000/expense/, which is the localhost while running Django server (python manage.py runserver)
